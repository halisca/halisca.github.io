Hailing from the beautiful, far-off land of Eugene, OR, Naomi James is a remarkably tall and generally amiable woman. Despite her best efforts towards becoming a high school dropout, she graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute in 2019 with a GPA of a certain number and has spent the subsequent years: successfully dropping out of college, feeling weird, feeling weirder, and trying to summon something. Sheâ€™s almost there --or rather IT is almost there-- She can feel it, O! can she feel it! She now resides near Pikesville, MD, and hopes to one day be left alone.
